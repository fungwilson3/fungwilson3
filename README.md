Hi 👋! I'm Wilson, an aspiring software engineer who loves solving problems and optimizing systems in the real-world with code, 👨‍🏫 teaching, and 📹 vlogging! 

- 🐻 I'm currently studying Computer Science with a minor in Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley.

- 🌱 I see computer science as a means to help us break down complex problems and create solutions respectively in many fields from technological advancements, to healthcare, to education. 

- 🏫 My coursework in AI, ML, Algorithms, Databases, and more have led me to understand how crucial computer sicnece is in any field. I am particularly interested in the intersection of AI and education and how AI can be utilized to help student learning rather than be used to cut corners. Beyong this, I hope to generalize AI within education to help students of all ages and studies. 

- 🧑‍🏫 I currently teach CS 61B, Data Structures, at UC Berkeley where I lead 1300+ students in lab work weekly, while providing office hour support. I enjoy teaching and hope to make computer science more accessible to those on campus and beyond!

- 💭 Outside of school, I enjoy playing volleyball and vlogging, where I release several videos a year of my memories in college with those who I love the most. 

- 📫 Please feel free to email me at fungwilson3@berkeley.edu with any questions!
